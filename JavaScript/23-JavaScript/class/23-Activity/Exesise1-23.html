// Explanation:
// In an arrow function, the 'this' context is inherited from the 
// surrounding scope, also known as lexical scoping. This means 
// that 'this' behaves the same way as in the surrounding code.
// In this case, 'this' is not used within the arrow function,
// so it's not necessary to bind it.
