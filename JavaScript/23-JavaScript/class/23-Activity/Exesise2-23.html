<body><h1>Exercise 2 . 
    Using the new keyword, create an object constructor Book that contains properties such as title, author, and year.
     Add a method getDetails that logs the book's details in the format "Title: [title], Author: [author], Year: [year]".
      Instantiate two books and log their details using the getDetails method.</h1>
    <script>
        // Object constructor Book
function Book(title, author, year) {
  this.title = title;
  this.author = author;
  this.year = year;

  // Method to log book details
  this.getDetails = function() {
    console.log(`Title: ${this.title}, Author: ${this.author}, Year: ${this.year}`);
  };
}

// Instantiate two books
const book1 = new Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", 1960);
const book2 = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", 1949);

// Log book details
book1.getDetails();
book2.getDetails();
